        <h2>Early Career</h2>
        <p>
          İlhan was born on June 15, 1925 in Menemen, İzmir. He was the elder
          brother of Çolpan İlhan, a famous actress and brother-in-law of Sadri
          Alışık, one of the most loved Turkish movie actors. His father,
          Muharrem Bedrettin İlhan, worked as a public prosecutor and governor
          for years. He was a rich and mundane man who always supported the
          bohemian lifestyle of his children. Because of his father's job, İlhan
          attended junior high in several cities. At the age of 16, he was
          arrested because he sent a poem about Nazım Hikmet, a member of the
          pro-Soviet Turkish Communist Party who was in prison at that time, to
          a female classmate. The police kept him in custody for three weeks. He
          was tried and sentenced to two months in prison. As a result, he was
          kicked out of school. Later, he enrolled in a high school in Istanbul,
          the private Işık (Light) College. In his senior year, his uncle sent
          one of Attila's poems to a poetry contest being held by the ruling
          People's Republican Party (CHP). The poem, "Cebberoğlu Mehemmed," was
          an epic imitating Hikmet's style and won second place. İlhan graduated
          from high school and was accepted into the Law School of Istanbul
          University, which he quit in his second year to visit Paris.

          <h2>Social criticism</h2>
          <p>
            Beginning in the late 1960s, İlhan wrote exceptional essays on
            Westernization, left-wing politics, sex and Kemalism. He compiled
            his essays in several volumes, including "Hangi Sol?" (Which Left?),
            "Hangi Batı?" (Which West?),"Hangi Seks?" (Which Sex), "Gerçekçilik
            Savaşı" (War on Realism) and "Ulusal Kültür Savaşı" (War on National
            Culture). İlhan was a left-Kemalist. Although a devoted socialist,
            İlhan always kept his nationalistic point of view, which is one of
            the six principles of Kemalism. In his later years, he appeared on
            TV in a one-man show discussing literary and social questions.
            Although he was married from 1968 until 1983, he had no children. He
            died of a heart attack on Oct. 10, 2005, in his residence in
            Kanlıca, Istanbul. His grave is in Aşiyan Cemetery near the
            Bosporus.
